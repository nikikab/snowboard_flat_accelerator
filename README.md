### Field
The present disclosure relates to improving the capability of the snowboarders to move on the parts of the slopes with little or no descend without unbinding their boots from the snowboard.   
### Background
In amateur snowboarding, while the snoaboarders reach part of the slopes with no or too low decend the snoaboarders have to unbind at least one of the boots from the snoaboard and move to a better possition, where he/she could bind it again and ride down the slope on speed. Depending on the frequency of such parts on the slopes this excersize could become quite annoying though.
